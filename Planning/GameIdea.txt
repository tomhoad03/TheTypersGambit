Enemies can have multiple words or harder words based on enemy strength
Game turns into a final boss
Powerups like barrels or speed things

Type boulder to roll a boulder

Theme:

Tutorial
Final boss
Artwork
Animations
Pause menu, game over, game finish

Feedback:
Initial idea needs a lot more mechanics otherwise the tutorial could be quite short and the game too simple
Add more mechanics (powerups, different enemies, earn health buy typing a word rather than killing an enemy, make the user use strategies, etc.)
